## API Integration

The app uses **The Movie Database (TMDb)** API for fetching movie data:
- **Base URL:** `https://api.themoviedb.org/3`
- **Endpoints Used:**
  - `/search/movie`: For searching movies by title.
  - `/discover/movie`: For browsing movies with filters.
  - `/genre/movie/list`: For fetching available genres.

### Example API Call
```javascript
axios.get("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie", {
  params: {
    api_key: "your_tmdb_api_key",
    page: 1,
    with_genres: "28", // Action genre
  },
});
```

---

## Customization

- **API Key:** Replace the placeholder API key with your own TMDb API key in the `App.js` file.
- **Features:** Extend the app by adding more filters or functionalities, such as sorting by popularity or runtime.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** TMDb API
- **Icons:** `react-icons`

---

## Known Issues

- Infinite scrolling may load duplicate movies if the API response contains overlapping results.

---

## Possible Improvements

1. **Debounced Search:** Implement debouncing for search input to reduce API calls.
2. **Improved Pagination Handling:** Ensure no duplicate movies are loaded during infinite scrolling.
3. **Dark/Light Theme Toggle:** Add support for toggling between dark and light themes.
